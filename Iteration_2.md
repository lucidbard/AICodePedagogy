# During the final version of the ICIDS2025 paper
I completed a final iteration (documented in GitHub as the most recent commits). During it, some minor formatting errors were addressed and I asked Claude Chrome Extension to complete a full test of the functionality of the first stage.

In addition, I wanted to include more branching narratives and to reformat the presentation accordingly. I used Claude to revise the narrative and have shared the conversation. The conversation is archived here:

I used the resulting suggestions to prompt Claude Sonnet 4.5 in VSCode GitHub Copilot.
